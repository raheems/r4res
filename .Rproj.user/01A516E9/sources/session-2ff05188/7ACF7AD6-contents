# Getting Started {#getting_started}

We need two pieces of software to get started with R for research. 

- First and foremoest, the R statistical software. 
- Secondly, the graphical user interface software, RStudio. 

R iteself has a graphical interface. However, RStudio has some nice features added to it that provies an improved R experience. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE). Althogh RStudio has a graphical intereface, for much of the actions,  you will need to write R codes. And that is a good thing. There are point and click menues for doing certain things such as configuring the R environment, and the RStudio itself. However, for most of our works, we will be writing codes using the build in editor in RStudio. 

## Download R and RStudio

R is freely available open source software that is free to use, modify, distribute under the GNU licence. This simply means you can use R for anything--hobby projects, funded projects, or comercial works. Absolutely free.

To download R, go to https://cloud.r-project.org/ and download the latest version for your operating system. R is available for Windows, Mac OSX, and of course, Linux systems.

RStudio is a free software under AGPL license. This is developed and maintained by RStudio which is a software company who develops and sells R-based software for enterprise use. 

To download RStudio, go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and click on the Download button for RStudio Desktop. The website will automatically detect your operating system and give you the link to download. 

## Installatiom

After downloading the software, first, install R and then install RStudio. I don't think it matters, but since RStrudio uses R as a backend engine, I think the logical sequence should be to install R first and then RStudio.

After its installed, you are good to get your hands dirty!
