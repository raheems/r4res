# Introduction

# Getting Started {#getting_started}

We need two pieces of software to get started with R for research.

-   First, the R statistical software, which is the engine that we will not see from outside. All computations and instructions that we pass will be through this engine

-   Second, the graphical user interface (GUI), RStudio. This is where we will write code, organize files and get our output generated. Rstudio interacts with the R in the back-end and we only use this as an interface that communicates back and forth with R.

R itself has a graphical interface. However, RStudio has some nice features added to it that provides an improved R experience. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE). Although RStudio has a graphical interface, for much of the actions, you will need to write R codes. And that is a good thing. There are point and click menus for doing certain things such as configuring the R environment, and the RStudio itself. However, for most of our works, we will be writing codes using the built in editor in RStudio.

# Installation

R can be installed both in Windows and Mac operating systems. Installation is straight forward like any other software you install in your operating system. In the following I am outlining the steps both for Windows and Mac OS.

R is freely available open source software that is free to use, modify, distribute under the GNU licence. This simply means you can use R for anything--hobby projects, funded projects, or commercial works. Absolutely free.

To download R, go to https://cloud.r-project.org/ and download the latest version for your operating system. R is available for Windows, Mac OSX, and of course, Linux systems.

RStudio is a free software under AGPL license. This is developed and maintained by RStudio which is a software company who develops and sells R-based software for enterprise use.


## Setting up R in Mac

### What you need

-   [Download R for MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). Note that R is available for both Intel-based Mac and the newer Apple silicon-based Macs. Please read carefully on the download page for the correct version.

-   [Download and install XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/) from this page or directly from xquartz.org website. Download and install the version as recommended on the R for MacOSx download page.

The website will automatically recognize that you are using a Mac operating system and it will present you the option to download RStudio Desktop software for your system. Click the link on that page to download. Save it in a location that you can find later. This is how it looks like when this page was accessed on 2023-02-16

## Setting up R in Windows


### What you need

-   [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). Most newer PCs are 64 bit. So download the version appropriate for your operating system. 

-   [Download and install RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) by visiting this page and following the instructions therein. The download link is available on this page. So please read and find the link and then download.

-   [Download Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). The website will automatically recognize that you are using a Windows operating system and it will present you the option to download RStudio Desktop software for your system. Click the link on that page to download. Save it in a location that you can find later. This is how it looks like when this page was accessed on 2023-02-16.

The step by step instructions are as follows.

### Step 1: Download and Install R for Windows

![](images/ch1-download-r-windows.png)

Go to [this page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and download R. Then install it.


### Step 2: Download and Install RTools

![](images/ch1-rtools.png)


[Download RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). This tool is needed because some packages in R need additional tools (to create the necessary development environment). 

![](images/ch1-rtools-download.png)

Download the version appropriate for your R version. If you installing the newest version of R then you should normally choose the latest version of RTools. 

At the time or writing this document, Rtools 4.3 should be selected. On this page you will find a link `Rtools43 installer` (the link will be something like: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/files/rtools43-5493-5475.exe). It is highly recommend that you download this file from the Rtools download page and NOT using the direct executable link.

### Step 3: Download and Install Rstudio

![](images/ch1-download-rstudio-mac.png)

[Download Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Once you are on this page, the website will automatically recognize that you are using a Windows operating system and it will present you the option to download RStudio Desktop software for your system. Click the link on that page to download. Save it in a location that you can find later.

The double click the executable file you just downloaded to install it. If you have difficulty installing a file or do not know how to do it, please search on YouTube for tutorials.
