That means, the organization of the contents is not finalized. As such, bookmarks would not be stable at this point. I would adivse not to bookmark any chapter or section. Instead, bookmark the website of the book which is http://r4res.eraheem.com. More importantly, bookmark the Issue queue - https://github.com/raheems/r4res/issues. If you have any questions or suggestions or feature requests, you can submit a request there. 1.2 Features There are many books on R in the market. Yet, this is another book that is being written. You wonder, why. Hereâ€™s what I think about this book. This book is specifically about using R for research in medical and clinical fields. Therefore, the examples in this book will be mostly if not all from the medical field. This book is straignt to the point and very specific without too much going into the nitty grity of the technicality. This book focuses on data analysis and report generation. As such, this book is particularly suitable for researchers in all fields, particularly in medical field. Tools used in this book are the most modern and up to date. The old-style programming (base R style of coding has a steep learning curve whereas the new tidyverse suite of libraries have made this much easier and provies flexible framework for quick data anlysis and producing publiccation quality graphics and tables. 1.3 Benefits of coding In this book, I will be teaching how to do research using R and particularly by writing R codes. There will be no point and click interface like you see in some statistical software packages such as the SPSS. We will be writing codes all along and I will show you how easy it is and how beneficial it is to write codes instead of using point and click interface. You might be thinking how writing code can beneficial when point and click is so easy. The biggest benefit of wiring code, which is also the greated limitation of point and click facility is that what you do is completely reproducible. By writing codes, you can easily try different things as data analysis involves a lot of trial and error and explorations. With a point and click facility, you cannot go one step back of your process if you make a mistake. Instead, you have to start from the beginning. Youre results are sharable with potential collaborators and also with the journals where you would submit your manuscript for publiccation. These days many journals ask for computer program to ensure reproduciblity. Lets dive in to the wonderful tool to power your research! 1.4 Before you begin Firstly, thank you for reading this book. I hope this will be beneficial for you. Skim throgh the book and take a look at the contents. If you see anything is missing or you want me to cover additional topics, please feel free to let me know by emailing to raheem at gmail dot com. You can also request features at the issue queue located at https://github.com/raheems/r4res/issues You would need to have an account at Github.com, which is absolutely free. Just sign up and submit a request there. This way, I will be able to manage the feature requests as well provide updates in an organized way. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Getting Started 2.1 Components to Installation", " Chapter 2 Getting Started We need two pieces of software to get ready for doing research with R. First and foremoest, the R statistical software. Secondly, the graphical user interface software, RStudio. Althogh it has a graphical intereface, much of the actions will still need you to write R codes. And that is a good thing. We will not be using point and click features except on rare ocasions. Working with R should start with installing R in your computer. If you have already R installed and the RStudio installed, then you can skip this chapter. For those who do not have R and R studio installed, please follow along. This should not be too long. Installation is easy these days. 2.1 Components to Installation We would need to pieces of software to install. The main R engine, and a graphical frontend, RStudio. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],
