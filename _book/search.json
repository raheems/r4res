There are point and click menus for doing certain things such as configuring the R environment, and the RStudio itself.

    "text": "2.1 Setting up the Expectations\nLearning a new program can be challenging and intimidating. If you have never programmed before, you may or may not feel it. However, if you have programmed in another language, you may feel a little uncomfortable at time because how R process certain aspects.\nWhatever may be your background, let keep the following principle in mind\n\nYou will face challenges as many things will go wrong\nHave patience. Things will turn in your favor. It’s only a matter of time\nIts a journey, and not a sprint. You have to pursue for a long time to achieve mastery or even a general understanding of the language. And this is true for any language. Think of who taught you your mother tongue? And exactly how long did it take to learn?"

Note, I did not mention software engineers. Because they generally do not use R in their workflow.\n\n2.2.1 Who should learn R?\nAnyone involved in research activity where statistical analysis is necessary. R is best in this regard, hands down. With R, you can create a reproducible workflow producing the best possible outputs in a publication-ready format. As of writing this book, no other system can provide as much functionality off-the-shelf.\n\n\n2.2.2 Should data scientists learn R?\nIt depends on how you define data scientist. If ‘science’ part of data science is important to you, then R would be the first choice. On the other hand, if machine learning or algorithms primarily developed for prediction purposes, my personal recommendation would be to use Python based solutions.\nTo summarize, a language should be chosen based on the deliverable. Be language agnostic, use the tool that does the job best. However, sometimes you may have to use one or the other because the organization and their IT setup supports one particular language."

That is, we won’t submit code to R ourselves but we will use the RStudio IDE to do that for us. We will instead focus or coding and keeping things organized in a nicer way.\n\n2.3.1.1 Mathematical operations\nTo get started with R, what better way to introduce to R but to start using it.
